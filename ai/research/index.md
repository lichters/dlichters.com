# Research index: what we already paid to find out

When to read this: before asking any research question, to see whether the answer already exists in results.md, and to learn how we run research.

## How we research (method and rules)

- **Rule (David, 2026-10-03):** everything that can be answered without our own files goes to Perplexity, never to Claude's own web search or memory. Reason: Claude usage is scarce and expensive, Perplexity Max is a flat fee. Own websites are still measured directly (curl).
- **Tool:** Perplexity Max in a separate anti-detect browser profile, incognito chats. Since 2026-09-29 any question may name our shop, suppliers, prices or people (David: "every question should go through, chats are incognito anyway").
- **How a question is written:** start with "As of <month year>", give the full context (shop, price, cost, shipping time, country), ask numbered sub-questions, demand "every number with source and date", prefer sources from 2025 on. For important questions ask for four sections: STUFE 1 (answer in max 3 sentences), STUFE 2 (max 15 lines, key numbers with source), STUFE 3 (full detail, tables, exceptions), ÜBERNAHME (the decision we should take, up to five tasks with steps, tool, cost and duration, ready-to-paste texts). Add "no follow-up questions, make sensible assumptions and state them". Each question also states which decision depends on it.
- **Depth levels:** normal (one answer, minutes), deep research (6-12 min, 50-180 sources), and "triple" (2-3 independent answers to the same question, then the same model checks them against each other and writes a contradiction table). Use triple for anything that moves money, law or a launch rule.
- **Model choice (test on 2026-09-28, 11 models, same question):** GPT-6 Sol / GPT-6.1 Sol Thinking is the default (most sources, careful about what is not measured yet). Grok is a good second opinion. Avoid "Best"/auto, Nemotron, GLM for numbers (old data, undated blogs). Depth does not protect against a wrong key number: check the one figure a decision hangs on at its original source.
- **Inbox flow:** a question is a small JSON file (fields: question, deep yes/no, the decision it serves, category) dropped in the inbox folder `~/timo/recherche/eingang/`; since 2026-09-29 a watcher checks the shared repo with `git ls-remote` every 10 s and starts the question ahead of the queue (measured 20 s from push to start; details https://dlichters.com/ai/ops/tools/02-6-research-perplexity-bridge-toolsuite-adapter-nan.md section 6) (older text, replaced on 2026-11-07: "a job runs every 20 minutes"; that described the queue run before the 10 s watcher). It sends it, stores the answer as a Markdown file with question, thread link, model, source count and fetch time, and writes a status table (waiting / done / failed). Typical failures: browser not running (needs a cold start), answer not finished after 12 minutes.
- **After the answer:** read only STUFE 1 and 2 first. Mark every outside number as a guess for us until our own data or the primary source confirms it. Write the decision and what changed into the decision log. Never ask the same question twice (it happened several times on 2026-10-08; the answers were near identical).

## The ten findings that matter most

1. For narrow questions ("conversion of X at price Y in December") a public measured number almost never exists. Plan with cross-industry benchmarks, replace with own data fast.
2. Meta pets benchmark (Triple Whale, 1 Aug 2025-31 Jul 2026): CPM 16.27 USD (the current figure; the older 9.56 USD is full-year 2025 across all markets, and the Perplexity model test of 2026-09-28 used it as the wrong answer that Claude Opus deep research gave), CTR 2.37 %, CVR 1.63 %, CPA 38.51 USD; all-industry median CPA 38.99 USD, Meta CVR median 1.53 %.
3. Kill rule for a 69.99 USD product with 47.01 USD break-even CPA: check at 47, pause at 94.02 USD spend without purchase, hard stop at 141.03 USD; never kill on CPM alone; a 3-day CPA with under 10 purchases is only a direction.
4. Scale by steps after 3 stable days (75, 150, 300, 500, 750, 1,000 USD/day), or at most +20 % per 72 h; never daily jumps, never identical duplicates.
5. US duty on a textile dog bed from China: 27 % (7 + 7.5 + 12.5) of customs value; de minimis is gone for China since 2 May 2025; ship DDP so the customer never pays on delivery.
6. FTC Mail Order Rule: any shipping promise needs a reasonable basis; if late, send a delay notice with wait-or-cancel choice and refund in full within 7 business days; store credit is not allowed as a substitute.
7. No sales tax registration needed below economic nexus in each state (about a dozen states still count 200 transactions); a German operator still needs a German imprint.
8. Shopify Payments: no fixed reserve or chargeback ban rate is published; first payout 7-14 business days; plan cash as if part of revenue can be held up to 120 days; chargeback program starts at 1.5 % over 90 days.
9. Payment cost on our German Basic store measured at 5.83 % per order (2 % currency conversion plus card fee); USD payout only on Advanced (1.5 %) or Plus (1 %).
10. Creative: about 5 % of new Meta creatives become spend winners (Motion, 578,750 creatives); pet hook rate benchmark about 20-21 %; hook rate barely predicts purchase cost.
